## Battle Scars:
Happy because I accomplished something big today and was so touched by the results;Such heartwarming support and advice. I need to thank them soon. Planning on creating 1 article for that. Although, extremely sad because of that pile of defeats. I'll just have to do better tomorrow.

Tomorrow's another day to conquer. Another day to win battles in these wars of mine.
